# EDA-for-Iris-Flower-dataset


The Iris flower dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).This dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes:sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and species.Iris dataset is used as a beginner friendly dataset for machine learning purpose.

Key points about the Iris dataset:

1. Features: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width (all in centimeters). 
2. Classes: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor, and Iris Virginica. 
3. Data size: 150 samples with 4 features each.
   
 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in understanding and visualizing the dataset. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in data science, and it can be visualized using various python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn etc.
